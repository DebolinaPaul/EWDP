Description: This package is a clustering technique that can provide partitioning of data in an unsupervised way. The additional advantage of using this method is that the number of clusters are not required to known a-priori. This method is useful in clustering high-dimensional data since the entropy regularizer on feature weights provides a method of feature selection.
